Hi, my name is Miracle. I am an Environmental Engineer but, I dared to dream to enter the Tech industry and here I am. I am a Full Stack Website Developer. Awesome right? Gosh I am so overwhemed, but I'm pushing harder and stronger buy God's grace.
I started my Tech Journey with Ingressive4Good x ZuriTeam, And it has been a best of my 3 months, Like the improvement was massive, the love and support is super. Je suis tres contente. 
Next, I enrolled for side hustle cohort 6.0, got a baseline score of 80% and I am really looking forward to it. At first i enrolled for front-end web development, but i thought deep and hard and went on to back-end development. This decision occured as a result of another recent involvement
I signed up with freecodecamp, That academy is super nice and self paced. I am learning new things with each course, I learnt about <fieldset><legend></legend></fieldset> also <figure><img><figcaption></figcaption></figure>, as at the time I am writing this I am learning about colours, C'est tres interesant et facile.
I dont wanna overwhelm myself with a lot of activities at once so I am giving myself a 6 months grace of learning intensively, By the special grace of God. By 2023, I will get a Job in the Tech Industry. watch out for this space.
